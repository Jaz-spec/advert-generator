   1. Logo Placement: As per the new specs, we can add the logo to the bottom-right corner of the canvas. This maintains a subtle but professional
      branding element.
   3. Layout Adjustment (Rule of Thirds): Instead of having the text at the very bottom, we can adjust its vertical position to better align with
      the rule of thirds, making the composition more visually appealing.
   4. Refined Color Palette: I can sample the exact blue from the logo to ensure brand consistency, instead of using a generic blue.
