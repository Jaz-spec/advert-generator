# Overview
This codebase is going to act as a rudimentary image builder. We will build reusable UI components, with no function, that can be assembled,  transformed, and jigsawed together to creat on-brand images for our co-ops adverts. 

If I reference an 'image' I want you to search for it in the `static/` folder.
If I reference a 'component' I want you to search in the $lib folder
