This is a test run for designing adverts from a codebase so appreciate any suggestions for how to improve this process. My prompts are going to start brief and get more defined, so any help in refining the prompts in this file is also encouraged. 

This is the website I want to copy the style of: https://www.foundersandcoders.com/

There is an image in the `static/` that I want included in this advert.

The content of the advert is as follow:
Header: Co-working at Founders and Coders
second header: For applicants

I want a canvas that is 1080x1350 px
